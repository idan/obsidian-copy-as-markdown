# Obsidian Copy As Markdown

What? I thought Obsidian _was_ markdown?

Well yes. But it also has `[[wikilinks]]`. Which are fine, really. But not when I want to copy some chunk of my note into another tool that doesn't understand wikilinks

## Usage

1. Select some text
2. Invoke the command `Copy as Markdown`
3. Your clipboard now contains the markdown with all `[[wikilinks]]` replaced to `wikilinks`
